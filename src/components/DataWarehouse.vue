    <p>I imagine that the user might be very interested in various aspects of his productivity. One way data warehousing
      could assist with this, is analyzing during what time of the day and on which days of the week the user gets the most
      tasks done and at what time and on which days he is usually "slacking". This could help the user identify weakspots in his
      general productivity and let him focus on improving these.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing that involves the blocker table might be an analysis on what usually blocks his tasks. Is it coworkers not responding to his
      emails? Business contacts not calling him back? What usually blocks his tasks from creation to being marked as done for the longest time?
      The user could then try and directly "attack" these blockers with "stronger" requests - or just try and avoid his worst blockers when possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly the user might want to utilize data warehousing on their todolist to analyze his planning skills themselves. Let's take the projects:
      Are his milestones usually well defined and don't take months to complete? Is he estimating the impact a milestone has on the overall progression
      of a project correctly? Is he maybe even splitting up his project in too many tiny fragments of milestones and tasks? Meaning, they are overplanning
      and are spending more time to come up with milestones and specific tasks than actually working on their project - which might not always be a bad thing.
